	<h3>Mutational Signatures</h3>

	<p>
		<span>
			Mismatch repair pathway status is evaluated by determining the number of small insertion/deletion events
			that occur in homopolymer regions
		</span>
		<br/>
		<span>
			within exonic sequence data across all genes on the panel, using an extension of a method previously
			developed in our laboratory (J Mol Diagn. 2017;19(1):84-91).
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		<span>
			Tumors with an elevated number of such events are classified as mismatch repair deficient (MSI-H),
		</span>
		<br/>
		<span>
			while tumors with a low burden of such events are classified as mismatch repair proficient (MSS).
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		<span>
			In some cases, it may be not be possible to make a definitive determination about mismatch repair pathway
			status.
		</span>
		<br/>
		<span>
			This may be due multiple factors, including low tumor content, suboptimal sequence quality, and the presence
			of another mutational signature.
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		<span>
			For these indeterminate cases, orthogonal testing via immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair protein
			expression or micro satellite
		</span>
		<br/>
		<span>
			instability testing by PCR should be considered.
