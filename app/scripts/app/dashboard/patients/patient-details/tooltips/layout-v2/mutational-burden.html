	<h3>Mutational Burden</h3>
	<p>
		<span>
			Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is calculated by determining the number of non-synonymous somatic mutations that occur
		</span>
		<br/>
		<span>per megabase of exonic sequence data across all genes on the panel.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>
			Measurement of tumor mutational burden may be less precise in tumors with a very low tumor content, and can potentially
		</span>
		<br />
		<span>
			be affected by the presence of rare germline variants that are not removed by population allele frequency-based filtering.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>
			The tumor mutational burden for a case is reported as a percentile in relation to all prior Profile clinical and research cohort 
		</span>
		<br />
		<span>
			samples sequenced on the current version of Oncopanel, as well as a percentile in relation to all tumors of that specific type.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>
			A tumor type-specific percentile is not provided for tumor types that have cumulatively been sequenced less than 10 times
		</span>
		<br />
		<span>due to insufficient data for meaningful comparison.</span>
