	<h3>Mutational Signatures</h3>
	<p>
		For tumors with 16 or more mutations, additional mutational signature analysis is performed based upon the pattern of nucleotide substitutions.<br/>
		Mutational signatures that can be detected using this approach include those associated with DNA damage due to ultraviolet light (UVA)<br/>
		exposure, tobacco smoke exposure, prior treatment with alkylating agents (including temozolomide), impaired POLE DNA polymerase function,<br/>
		and APOBEC enzyme dysregulation. These signatures should be interpreted as observed patterns consistent with the appropriate pathologic<br/>
		mechanism, but not definitive assertions. Failure to detect a mutational signature despite a relevant clinical context may result from low<br/>
		numbers of mutations identified by this targeted assay, low tumor content, and/or alternative mechanisms of tumorigenesis. If the reported<br/>
		mechanism is unexpected (i.e., a UV-signature in tumor arising at a visceral site), an appropriate clinical correlate should be identified<br/>
		before initiating a change in management.
