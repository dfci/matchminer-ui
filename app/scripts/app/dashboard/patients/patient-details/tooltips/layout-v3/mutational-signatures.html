	<h3>Mutational Signatures</h3>
	<p>
		<span>Mismatch repair pathway status is evaluated by determining the number of small insertion/deletion events within exonic that occur in homopolymer regions</span><br/>
		<span>sequence data across all genes on the panel, using an extension of a method previously developed in our laboratory (J Mol Diagn. 2017;19(1):84-91).</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		<span>Tumors with an elevated number of such events are classified as mismatch repair deficient (MSI-H), while tumors with a low burden of such events are</span><br/>
		<span>classified as mismatch repair proficient (MSS).</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		<span>In some cases, it may be not be possible to make a definitive determination about mismatch repair pathway status. This may be due multiple factors,</span><br/>
		<span>including low tumor content, suboptimal sequence quality, and the presence of another mutational signature.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		<span>For these indeterminate cases, orthogonal testing via immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair protein expression or micro satellite instability testing</span><br/>
		<span>by PCR should be considered.</span>
