                    ImmunoProfile is a test that quantifies the expression of immune-regulatory proteins
                    within the tumor microenvironment.

                <p>
                    ImmunoProfile uses multiplex immunofluorescent staining and imaging. Multiplex immunofluorescent
                    staining is done on FFPE samples. This technology uses multiple colors to identify different cells and
                    proteins at the same time on the same slide. Once multiplex staining is complete, an image of the slide
                    is acquired for analysis. Image analysis software is then used to determine the number and percentage of
                    cells positive for the selected biomarkers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The current version of ImmunoProfile tests for 6 different proteins/markers on one slide: DAPI, PD-L1 (clone E1L3N),
                    CD8, PD-1, FOXP3 and a tumor marker (Cytokeratin, PAX8, PAX5, SOX10). These proteins have been selected because
                    they are targets for existing immunotherapies and there are publications supporting their use as
                    predictors of response.
